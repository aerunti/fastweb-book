Developers don’t really want to change frameworks or languages. They need a really good
reason to use something not yet familiar.
Here we explore some good use cases to use rust.


I will not deceive you. Rust is a language with a slower learning curve, and for web development, there are probably many frameworks available that will deliver results faster.

But why and when to use Rust for web development?

Good reasons to use rust in a project are:

- The project is critical and will be used for decades : Rust projects are difficult to develop, but easy to maintain
- Requirements demand stability, performance and security: Rust frameworks are among the fastest on the market, and still provide stability and security. 
- The quality of project is most important than time to deliver. 

One of the objectives of this course is to offer programmers familiar with frameworks that use the MVC (Model, View, Controller) design pattern, such as Laravel, Django, Web2py, Rails, among others, a 'comfortable' environment to develop in Rust.
