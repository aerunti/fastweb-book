# FastWeb Course

This course will guide you to develop and deploy an online shop with blog and sample api using
Rus stack - Actix-web as framework, Cornucopia to access postgresql, and minijinja for
templating.
We organize the final code in a MVC-like structure, so if you use Laravel, Django or similar
frameworks, you will be comfortable.

Students of this course will use Linux (wsl or remote can work), Visual Studio Code, Git,
Postgresql, Dbeaver (or another interface for Postgres)

Our likely target audience is developers who already developed Fullstack web apps using MVC
Frameworks like Laravel, Flask, Django or others to feel comfortable using Rust to develop
faster solutions using Rust. The developer should already know the basics of Rust, since we will
show how to ‘use’ Rust ecosystem to develop for the web, but will not ‘teach’ Rust itself.

So, this course is not intended for those who either have no experience with web development
(with other languages) or even don’t know the basics of Rust language. Since we will offer the
code for examples and go through all the process to build a complete solution, maybe you can
learn about web development and rust while doing the course

# Goals
The aim for this course is to get a developer who is not currently using Rust to develop web
apps how use a structure to write and deploy their solutions
Broadly, this entails:
- Configure a basic Actix-web project and configure a subdomain in nginx to access it
- How use minijinja to append templating
- How setup Cornucopia, redis and postgresql to data persistence
- A Basic database structure to support tenants, and RBAC (Role Based access Control),
controllers and templates to manage , and use sessions
- How send emails to users
- How to add content like blog
- How to show products
- How to manage a cart shop
- How integrate with a external API (use it)
- How to create a documented API (to others use it)


# The process of learning

The most important thing in the learning process is to be able, given a problem, to gather the available information, and identify the points that are useful for building a reasoning that is capable of solving that problem in the best possible way, given the available information. A solution, even if precarious, may raise more questions, which will lead to the search for more information, which may lead to another, more advanced solution to the problem.

With this realization, there is no "correct" answer, only the best possible answer to devise given the available information.
