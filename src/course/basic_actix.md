### Guiding Questions:
- How start a project using actix-web and configure it for development/production?
- How do I configure using .env file?
- How do I create a subdomain in nginx for my project and secure it with certbot?
Learning Outcomes
- Students will perform create a new project using actix-web
- Students will edit files in Visual Studio Code with Remote-ssh plugin

### Actix-web is the base framework we choose to work.
We start with a very simple project and configure it using a .env file and providing a subdomain
to work with.
At end, we finish it with a git commit to learn to work with code versioning
Students will:
1. Create a new project
2. Add crates to Cargo.toml
3. Use crates in main.rs
4. Configure .env
5. Configure subdomain in nginx
6. Generate a ssl certificate (optional)
